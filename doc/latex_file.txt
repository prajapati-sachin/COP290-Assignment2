\section*{Introduction}

This is a mathematical model for implementation of a simulator for  \textbf{Starling Murmuration}. In this document we will look at certain aspects of Murmuration in starlings like:-
\begin{itemize}
\item How does each bird decides it speed and direction to move?
\item Does the movement of a bird depends on other birds also?
\item What happens at an individual level for each bird?
\item On what all factors does the movement of a bird depends? 

\end{itemize}

\section*{Factors deciding the movement of birds}
Though the actual movement of starlings depend on various factors but for a very basic model we could assume that the movement of each starling depends mainly on these three factors:-
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Seperation}- Steer to avoid crowding neighbours.
    \item \textbf{Alignment}- Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates.
    \item \textbf{Cohesion}- Steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates. 
\end{itemize}

Apart from these, more advanced models could also report the effect of fear, emotions, change of leadership, escaping an enemy, looking for food etc.

\section*{Calculating the position of a boid}
Suppose the position of a boid in 3D space is given $(x, y, z)$.
Now to find the new position of boid after time $\delta$t we need to have the velocity of the boid. If we have the velocity of boid $v_x, v_y, v_z$ in $X, Y, Z$ direction respectively then the new position of boid, let $(x_n_e_w, y_n_e_w, z_n_e_w)$ is given by $$x_n_e_w = x + v_x *(\delta t) $$
$$
y_n_e_w = y + v_y *(\delta t)
$$
$$
z_n_e_w = z + v_z *(\delta t)$$

\subsection*{Calculating the velocity of boid}
As described above the velocity of each boid depends on three factor that are Seperation, Alignment, Cohesion.

Suppose $N(r)$ is the list of all the boids which are neighnours of a given boid with position $p$ and velocity $v$, within a circle of radius $r$, and we know the position and velocity of each boid present in list.

To account for the affect of \textbf{Seperation Factor} on the velocity of boid. We take a rather small radius around boid$r$ let say $r_1$ and find the list of all the neighbours in that given circle. After that we find the mean position of all the boids given in $N(r_)$ and find a vector from the position of original boid to that mean. Now as a result of seperation effect we will have a velocity in opposite direction of this vector in order to avoid crowding. Let say $v_s_e_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n$ is the effect on velocity due to seperation and is given by $$v_s_e_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n = seperation_f_a_c_t_o_r * (p-\frac{\sum_{n \epsilon N(r_1)} position(N(n))}{N(r_1)})$$
where $seperation_f_a_c_t_o_r$ would be negative as boid moves away from average position to avoid crowding. 



To account for the affect of \textbf{Alignment Factor} on the velocity of boid. We take a radius around boid $r$ let say $r_2$ and find the list of all the neighbours in that given circle. After that we find the mean velocity of all the boids given in $N(r_2)$. 
Let say $v_a_l_i_g_n_m_e_n_t$ is the effect on velocity due to alignment and is given by $$v_a_l_i_g_n_m_e_n_t = alignment_f_a_c_t_o_r * (\frac{\sum_{n \epsilon N(r_2)} velocity(N(n))}{N(r_2)})$$
where $alignment_f_a_c_t_o_r$ would be positive as boid moves in the direction of average velocity of neighbours.


To account for the affect of \textbf{Cohesion Factor} on the velocity of boid. We take a radius around boid $r$ let say $r_3$ and find the list of all the neighbours in that given circle. After that we find the mean position of all the boids given in $N(r_3)$ and find a vector from the position of original boid to that mean. Now as a result of cohesion effect we will have a velocity in same direction of this vector in order to move towards the centre of mass of neighbours. Let say $v_c_o_h_e_s_i_o_n$ is the effect on velocity due to cohesion and is given by $$v_c_o_h_e_s_i_o_n = cohesion_f_a_c_t_o_r * (p-\frac{\sum_{n \epsilon N(r_3)} position(N(n))}{N(r_3)})$$
where $cohesion_f_a_c_t_o_r$ would be positive as boid moves towards the average position of its neighbours.

Taking in account all the three factors we can say that the new velocity of a boid $v_n_e_w$ is given by $$v_n_e_w = v_o_l_d + v_s_e_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n + v_a_l_i_g_n_m_e_n_t + v_c_o_h_e_s_i_o_n$$

Now, using these velocities we could easily calculate the new positions of the boids and trace the trajectory in which they move. We could also change the factors like $alignment_f_a_c_t_o_r, seperation_f_a_c_t_o_r, cohesion_f_a_c_t_o_r$ to make some variations in the movements of the boids.
